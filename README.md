# ARRPL: All Rights Reserved Public License (DRAFT)

**Work in progress**, do not use.

The ARRPL is a public license built on the idea that all published
creative works belong to the public first, and to the creator second
-- and only to the degree to which rights are explicitly named. That
is, the public reserves all rights by default, contrary to the legal
standing of intellectual property in the United States and similar.

## The license

The full text of version 1 of the license is as follows:

> In the spirit of the commons, the public is granted full rights
> to use, perform, alter, distribute, and re-license the work,
> including all corresponding or equivalent rights not mentioned here,
> except for those explicitly excepted by the creator
> where the licensing is declared.
> All moral rights (e.g. attribution and integrity) are waived
> and licenses are automatically granted
> to any patent and trademark rights
> necessary for exercise of other rights.

## How do I use it?

You can A) include the text of the license, B) link to this repo, or
C) simply refer to the license by name, such as:

    © Foo Corp 2015, all rights reserved

This refers to the latest published version of the ARRPL since it does
not specify a version. It is traditional to include the © symbol,
original author, and date in order to aid in automated discovery, give
credit to the author, and to indicate some of the rights being
released.
